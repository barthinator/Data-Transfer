# Copy-Machine

Used to copy data from a computer to the KITT backup server of IMT.

Issues Right Now:

Will only work on Mac because it uses an apple script to connect to the backup server (which is fine for the mac pros)

Breaks when copying certain files not sure why but it usually gives an IOException

Need to fix the progress bar to display accurate data live and not after it is finished
